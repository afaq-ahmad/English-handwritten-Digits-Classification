# English-handwritten-Digits-Classification
Human written styles vary person to person even for a single letter or a digit. But there is some similarity in those digits and some unique features that help human to understand it by visualizing different digits. In this we are performing these digits classification, so machine can learn from it and recognized unique features and layout of individual digits. We have applied Histogram-Of-Oriented-Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) on the images to extract features of digits. We used Support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Network Supervised Algorithms for digits classification. All these algorithms have some pros and cons like time consumption, dataset length and Accuracy. We have received 98% accuracy of classification using Neural Network of 3 layers.
